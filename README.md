# Task 5 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset.
The objective is to understand the structure of the data, identify missing values,
analyze patterns, and explore relationships between different variables.

## Dataset
- Dataset used: Titanic (train.csv)
- The dataset contains passenger information such as age, gender, class, fare, and survival status.

## Steps Performed
- Loaded and inspected the dataset
- Checked data types and missing values
- Performed basic data cleaning (handling missing values)
- Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
- Visualized data using graphs and plots
- Identified patterns, trends, and outliers (outliers were not removed)

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Observations
- Female passengers had a higher survival rate compared to males.
- Passengers traveling in first class showed better survival chances.
- Fare values are highly skewed with several high-value outliers.
- Age and Fare variables contain outliers, which represent real-world data behavior.

## Conclusion
The analysis helped in understanding the dataset characteristics and key factors
affecting passenger survival. Outliers were retained as they represent valid
real-world scenarios.
